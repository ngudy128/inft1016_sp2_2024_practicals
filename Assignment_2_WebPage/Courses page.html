<article> <h2>Overview</h2>        
<p>My first University year at UniSa was quite interesting and relaxing to be honest. I met a lot of new friends from different backgrounds and most of them are very frienly.
    This is also my first time studying in a foreign country and I think Australia in general and Adelaide in particular is a wonderful place for international students like me. </p>
<h3>Things that I like</h3> 

<p>Great campus with modern technologies and comfortable environment</p>        
<p>Friendly staffs and tutors that always support the students</p>  
<p>Many intersting events </p>       

<h3>Difficulties</h3> 

<p>Sometimes it's hard to find the right classroom because the campus is too big</p>        
<p>Some places have no wifi</p>
